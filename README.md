# Rock-Paper-Scissors-OpenCV-AI
Rock Paper Scissors game using opencv, convolutional neural network using tensorflow.

Initial user is required to create its own dataset, consisting of images of his hand gestures of rock, paper and scissors. Data can we collected live using opencv which I did in this project. Below are the images attached depicting the data collections.

# PREDICTIONS

Now that the data is collected, we can train our model over our dataset and can see the model predictions.

# Real Time Game

Now with the accurate predictions, we are ready to play rock, paper, scissors in realtime with computer. We also keep scores and whoever wins first five attempts wins the round.
